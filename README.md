# üîê Applied Cryptography & Secure Systems

![Cryptography Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x300/4338ca/ffffff?text=Applied+Cryptography+%26+Secure+Systems)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Applied Cryptography** course. This repository contains all the hands-on lab exercises for the semester.

> üìå **Our philosophy:** *You learn by doing.*

Forget endless static slides‚Äîhere, you‚Äôll **write code**, **break ciphers**, **analyze network traffic**, and build a **practical portfolio** of cryptographic skills.

We explore modern cryptographic systems through Python, real-world tools, and secure development practices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To ensure everyone has a uniform environment, **all labs are conducted inside a Kali Linux Virtual Machine (VM)**.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Kali Linux

- Import the VM into VirtualBox or VMware using your platform‚Äôs import wizard.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your Tools

Open a terminal inside your Kali VM and install the essential tools for this course:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-pip xclip openssl
üîß Set Up Git & GitHub
3Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Configure Your GitHub Account
Go to GitHub.com and create a free account if you don‚Äôt already have one.

Configure Git with your name and email (used for commits):


git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.student_email@example.com"
4Ô∏è‚É£ Fork and Clone the Repository
Visit the course repository:
üëâ https://github.com/callysthenes/cryptography_qblcrypt

Click Fork in the upper-right to create your own copy.

Clone your fork to your Kali VM:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone git@github.com:your_username/cryptography_qblcrypt.git
cd cryptography_qblcrypt
üí° Replace your_username with your actual GitHub username.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up SSH Access (One-Time Only)
To enable pushing code securely via SSH:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.student_email@example.com"
# Press Enter three times to accept the defaults

# Start SSH agent and add your key
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -sel clip
Then:

Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key

Paste the copied key and save.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Submit Your Work
Each time you complete lab work:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Lab submission by $(git config user.name)"
git push origin main
Then open your browser:

Navigate to your forked repo

‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Responsibility
The tools and techniques taught‚Äîespecially those involving Kali Linux‚Äîare powerful and must be used responsibly.

‚ùó Use your knowledge only on systems you own or are authorized to test.
Unauthorized use is unethical, illegal, and strictly forbidden.

ü§ñ Use LLMs for Mastery
LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini can help you go deeper into any topic. Use them for clarity, exploration, or guided practice.

üß† Example Prompt
Act as a cybersecurity protocol designer. Explain the concept of Forward Secrecy in TLS.
Why does an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman handshake (DHE/ECDHE) provide this property, while a classic RSA key exchange does not?
Describe a scenario where the lack of forward secrecy could be catastrophic.

Happy hacking ‚Äî ethically.
