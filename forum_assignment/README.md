# Forum Assignments - Weekly Cybersecurity Challenges

## Welcome, Operatives

This directory contains the resources and scripts related to the weekly cybersecurity challenges posted on our class forum. Each challenge is designed to be a practical, hands-on mission that will test your understanding of the concepts we cover in class.

The goal is not just to get the right answer but to learn how to think like a security professionalâ€”analyzing problems, building tools, and defending systems.

### How It Works

1.  **New Challenge Weekly:** Each week, a new challenge corresponding to the current lecture topic will be posted on the class forum.
2.  **Use Your Tools:** You are expected to use your **Kali Linux VM** as your primary operating environment. The challenges will require you to use tools like **Python**, **openssl**, **Wireshark**, `iptables`, and various command-line utilities.
3.  **Leverage AI:** You are highly encouraged to use an **LLM** (like Manus, ChatGPT, etc.) as a "digital consultant." Use it to understand complex concepts, debug code, or get ideas, but remember to document how you used it in your reports.
4.  **Submission:** All solutions, reports, and scripts must be submitted as a reply to the corresponding challenge thread on the forum. Follow the specific submission instructions for each challenge.

### General Submission Guidelines

* **Code:** Always paste your Python or shell scripts inside a proper code block for readability.
* **Reports:** Structure your analysis reports clearly with headings and answer all the required questions.
* **GitHub (Bonus):** For challenges involving code, you will often have the opportunity for bonus points by forking the class repository, adding your work, and creating a pull request.

This is your chance to move beyond theory and get your hands dirty. The challenges are designed to be tough but rewarding.

Good luck.
