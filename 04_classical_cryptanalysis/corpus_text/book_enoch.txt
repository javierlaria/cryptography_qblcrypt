And thence I went to another place, which was still more horrible
than the former, and I saw a horrible thing. A great fire there
which burnt and blazed, and the place was cleft as far as the abyss,
being full of great descending columns of fire. Neither its extent
or magnitude could I see, nor could I conjecture.

Then I said: 'How fearful is the place and how terrible to look upon!'
Then Uriel answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me,
and said unto me: 'Enoch, why hast thou such fear and affright?'
And I answered: 'Because of this fearful place, and because of the
spectacle of the pain.' And he said unto me: 'This place is the
prison of the angels, and here they will be imprisoned for ever.'

And from there I went to another place, greater than the former,
and I saw a vision of all the torments of the earth and the abyss.
And there appeared columns of fire descending from the sky, and
I heard voices of bitterness and pain, cries from those who were
kept there, and the roar of the burning columns, thick smoke rising.

And I asked the angel who was with me, saying, 'Who are these who
suffer so greatly, and what is the purpose of this place?' And he
answered me and said, 'These are the souls of the wicked, those
who rebelled against the Most High, and their punishment is eternal,
for here their pain never ceases.'

And I saw the pillars of the earth shaken and the gates of the
abyss opened, and winds blowing through the chambers of flame. And
the spirits trembled, and the holy ones bowed in reverence. And
the angel said, 'All things have their appointed time and place;
the righteous shall rejoice, but the unrighteous face judgment
everlasting.
